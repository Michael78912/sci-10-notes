friction always opposes motion
any two surfaces rubbing together will cause friction
the rougher the surface, the greater the friction
friction makes heat
kinetic friction means friction while moving
static friction means friction while not moving

friction helps with many things, like making fires, or stopping a car. it is often something to be reduced, however due to the fact that it wastes energy.
