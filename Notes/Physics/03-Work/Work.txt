Work in physics is Force X distance. that is, the force applied to an object in newtons, and how far it was moved. work is measured in JOules.

equation:

            W = Fd
            ^   ^^
Work -------+   |+--- Distance
                |
              Force

Work is NOT being done, if there is no movement. for example, if you are pushing a wall, but it is not moving, no matter how much force you put on it, you are not doing work.


to calculate work, just to the force (in newtons) X the distance (in meters).

Gravity:
 gravity is also a force, and it is very easy to calculate:
                           F = mg
where m is the mass of the object (kg)
g = 9.8 m/s² (the gravitational constant of earth)
F is the weight of the object
