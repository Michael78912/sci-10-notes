the creation of the universe was called the big bang. this was when all the matter formed. in a few minutes after the beginning, all the small particles had formed into hydrogen gas. this created stars over a few million years.
the big bang was discovered partly through cosmic microwave background radiation which allowed them to see what hasd happened long ago, and the doppler effect, which compresses waves ahead of it, and stretches waves behind it. this helped to see it by showing that the universe was expanding, as the waves were longer from stars, which showed they were moving away.
