the cloud of a nebula is disturbed by a shockwave of some kind, possibly from a supernova far away. this causes it to be clumped together in a few areas, which then attract each other with gravity. soon after, the cloud begins to spin and flatten out, which attracts  even more particles. ths condenses into a sun, and some of the particles that were left behind become the planets.
