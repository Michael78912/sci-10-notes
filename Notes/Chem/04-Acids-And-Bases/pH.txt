the pH scale is a logarithmic scale (which means it goes up/down 1 it is 10x more/less than the the one before it.)
7 is neutral
above seven is basic
below seven is acidic

this means that an acid with a ph of 3 is 10X stronger than one with a pH of 4.

an indicator is often used to determine a compound's pH. Litmus is used most commonly. if the litmus paper turns red after being put in a compound, then it is acidic. id it is blue, then it is basic.

there are also many other ways of telling the pH, including other substances, and meters.
