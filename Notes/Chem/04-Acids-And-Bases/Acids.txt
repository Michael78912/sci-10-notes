if you know the formula of a chemical, then you can identify it as an acid or not. an acid's formula usually start with Hydrogen (H) (if they have a carbon, then C is first)
many acids only act as acids when they are disolved in water, in which case they are written as aqueus (aq).

To name an acid, follow these rules:
for an acid with hydrogen + one element: Hydrogen + {element}ide = Hydro{element}ic acid
(HF(aq) = hydrogen flouride = hydroflouric acid
for acids with hydrogen and a polyatomic molecule ending in ate:
Hydrogen + {molecule}ate = Hydro{molecule}ic acid
for Hydrogen and a polyatomic molecule ending in ite:
Hydrogen + {molecule}ite = {molecule}ous acid
